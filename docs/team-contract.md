## Decision-Making Process

### Routine Decisions
- Method: Assigned role owner decides (e.g., Frontend Lead decides on UI framework)
- Timeline: Decided within 24 hours with team notification
- Communication: Post decision in team chat with brief rationale

### Major Decisions
- Method: Team discussion required; consensus preferred, otherwise 3/4 majority vote
- Examples: Project scope changes, technology stack selection, major architectural decisions
- Timeline: Discuss in team meeting, allow 48 hours for reflection, decide within one week
- Documentation: Record in decisions.md file in repository

### If We Can't Agree:
1. Each person researches their position and presents key pros/cons
2. Take a vote with majority rule (3/4 required for major decisions)
3. If still stuck, consult instructor for guidance

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Step 1: Direct Communication
- Address issues directly with the person(s) involved within 48 hours
- Use "I feel" statements, not accusations (e.g., "I feel overwhelmed when..." not "You never...")
- Focus on the problem, not the person
- Seek to understand before being understood

### Step 2: Team Discussion
- If Step 1 doesn't resolve it, bring to full team in next scheduled meeting
- Everyone gets a chance to speak without interruption
- Focus on finding solutions, not assigning blame
- Document the agreed resolution and follow-up steps

### Step 3: Instructor Mediation
- Contact the instructor via email (CC all team members)
- Provide brief summary of issue and steps already taken
- Instructor will schedule mediation session

### Common Issues & Agreed Solutions

**If someone misses a deadline:**  
- Team checks in 48 hours before deadline to identify issues early
- If missed, person must complete work within 48 hours or task is redistributed
- Third missed deadline triggers formal team discussion

**If someone isn't responding to communications:**  
- Send direct follow-up message after 24 hours
- After 48 hours of no response, escalate to other team members
- After 72 hours, contact instructor

**If workload feels unequal:**  
- Review GitHub contributions and task completion at weekly meeting
- Discuss capacity constraints openly
- Rebalance tasks if needed; adjust roles if pattern persists

**If technical disagreement arises:**  
- Each person documents their approach with pros/cons
- Prototype both solutions if feasible (time-boxed to 2 hours each)
- Decide based on objective criteria: performance, maintainability, time-to-implement
